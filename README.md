# chat-docs-gen

Create a web application that enables a user to log in and then chat with documents (PDFs, Word and Excel) using Retrieval Augmented Generation. The documents can be uploaded by the user. Each user is assigned to a user group by an admin. Any time a user uploads a document, all the other members of the user group have access to it. The code repository should be split into a backend developed in Python and a frontend developed in React. The code repository will also comprise an API (developed using FastAPI) that will make the frontend and backend communicate.
